## TL;DR / elevator pitch
Finally a decent Android app allowing you to contribute to your parish with ease and without limits. For too long only the offering of prayers was possible remotely. Now together we can godlily* pass your life's work to the hands of pious Servants**.

## App conception

The application will mainly be used during Holy Mass, which will allow you to make a sacrifice without having to have cash, simply and safely. This is not the only option - in the case of other intentions, through the application you can also make a sacrifice from home or any other place (e.g. a sacrifice for giving the Sacrament or ordering Mass for the chosen intention). In addition, parishioners often declare regular payments to the parish, so the application will enable recurring payments. We also consider the optional function of the application as a local/district social network.

Potential users are believers who are moving with the times and the digitization. There are three basic groups among users.
The first of these is young people, often thinking about the Church as an unfriendly and not-timely institution. Such an application could change their view of the Church, warm up its image, and thus bring young people closer to the Church.
The second group is busy adults, accustomed to the fact that in most places they can pay by card or phone and do not always have time to make sure that their wallet has the right amount of cash to be able to make a sacrifice during Mass or talking with the priest for topic of giving the Sacraments to children.
The third group is older people who may have the fear of carrying cash because of the risk of assault or being robbed. In addition, they may have limited mobility and the ability to order Mass. without leaving home would be a great help for them.
